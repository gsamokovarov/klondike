| My mom's solitaire |
'===================='

All that my mother do on her computer is to play the solitaire. However,
she managed to somehow broke the Windows 7 games and now they won't run.
Every other solitaire I found on the internet was either full of ads,
had really small cards or had a lot of clutter and she gets lost in all
of that. So every time I'm in town she occupies my laptop in a zombie
like state, doing nothing than playing Gnome's AisleRiot solitaire.

I finally decided to end that and set out to make her a solitaire she
would play on her own computer. I had the following requirements:

1. Make it simple with a few dependencies.
2. Don't waste time on it.

Thankfully I have found Jo Liss' one and based my efforts on top of
hers, so that would clear off point 2. However I had to drop the rails
dependency as running a server on her Windows PC would mean trouble.
Having to download the rails dependencies would too, as she doesn't have
a constant internet connection and my telecom dongles drop their speed
after a given number of downloaded megabytes. I also dropped sprockets,
slim, sass, compass and all the ruby stuff and built all the javascripts
with a simple makefile. After I had the game running I set to make the
cards bigger, so she could see them better. Hopefully that was not hard
as Jo Liss had left the original SVG of the cards in the tree, so I was
able to scale them to my likings. After the cards was scaled, I removed
the undo button, as my mother was not using it. Finally I have built and
transfered the cards on her PC and made a shortcut on her desktop to
easily start them and...

Voila! Now she has her perfect solitaire.
